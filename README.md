## Requirements and prerequisites

Perform the following tasks to prepare to deploy your IBM Content Collector for SAP images on Kubernetes:

- Prepare your IBM Content Collector for SAP environment. These procedures include setting up storage, and configuration files that are required for use and operation. You must complete all of the [preparation steps for IBM Content Collector for SAP]( https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_4.0.0/doc/container/tsk_preparing.html) before you are ready to deploy the container images. 

- Prepare your Kubernetes environment. See [Preparing for deployment with an operator]( https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSRW2R_4.0.0/doc/container/tsk_preparing.html)

## Deploying with an operator

The IBM Content Collector for SAP operator is built from the Red Hat and Kubernetes Operator Framework, which is an open source toolkit that is designed to automate features such as updates, backups, and scaling. The operator handles upgrades and reacts to failures automatically.

To prepare your operator and deploy your IBM Content Collector for SAP components, follow the instructions for your operator platform:

- [Certified Kubernetes](operator/platform/k8s/README.md)
- [Red Hat OpenShift](operator/platform/ocp/README.md)
